      <h2>About Gaine Africa</h2>
      <p>
        Gaine Africa was born out of a need to bridge the gap between small-scale
        farmers and real-time agricultural data. As a developer passionate about
        leveraging technology for impact, I saw firsthand how access to market trends,
        predictive analytics, and digital financial tools could transform agribusiness.
        This project started as a Portfolio Project for ALX and has since grown into
        a mission-driven platform aiming to empower farmers with data-driven
        decision-making.
